    "# Simple Agent with Web Search\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is based in the demo published by https://github.com/opendatahub-io/llama-stack-demos/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will introduce how to build a simple agent using Llama Stack's agent framework, enhanced with a single tool: the builtin web search tool. This capability will  allow the agent to retrieve up to date external information beyond the limits of its training data. This is an important step toward developing a more capable and autonomous agent.\n",

    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk you through how to build your own AI agent who can search the web:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configure a Llama Stack agent.\n",
    "2. Enhance the agent by providing it access to a specific tool\n",
    "2. Interact with the agent and tests its use of the web search tool.\n",

    "Before starting this notebook, ensure that you have:\n",
    "- Followed the instructions in the [Setup Guide](./Level0_getting_started_with_Llama_Stack.ipynb) notebook. \n",
