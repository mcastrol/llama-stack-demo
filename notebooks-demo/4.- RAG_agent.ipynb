    "# Level 4: RAG Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an example of executing queries with a RAG agent in Llama Stack. It shows how to initialize an agent with the RAG tool provided by Llama Stack and to invoke it such that retrieval from a vector DB is activated only when necessary. The notebook also covers document ingestion using the RAG tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a simple (non-agentic) RAG tutorial, please refer to [Level1_simple_RAG.ipynb](./Level1_simple_RAG.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connecting to a llama stack server.\n",
    "2. Indexing a collection of documents into a vector DB for later retrieval.\n",
    "3. Initializing the agent capable of retrieving content from vector DB via tool use.\n",
    "4. Launching the agent and using it to answer user queries about the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, ensure you have the following:\n",
    "- Followed the instructions in the [Setup Guide](./Level0_getting_started_with_Llama_Stack.ipynb) notebook. \n",
    "- Llama Stack server should be using milvus as its vector DB provider.\n"

Templates and Operators\\nLet’s talk about OpenShift 4.12 templates and operators, both powerful ways to create and deploy\\napplications on OpenShift.\\n12.1. Templates\\nOpenShift templates are YAML or JSON files that describe the desired state of application\\ncomponents, such as pods, services, routes, and build configurations. You can use templates to\\ndefine reusable and parameterized application configurations that can be instantiated with a single\\ncommand or through the web console.\\nTemplates can help you simplify and automate the creation of complex applications, such as\\nmicroservices, that consist of multiple components that need to communicate with each other.

      "\u001b[35mBased on the provided text, here is a summary of the key points related to OpenShift templates and odo tool:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Templates**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Templates are used to define reusable and parameterized application configurations for OpenShift.\n",
      "* Templates can be used to simplify and automate the creation of complex applications, such as microservices.\n",
      "* Templates can help share best practices and common patterns for deploying applications on OpenShift.\n",
      "* A template definition is represented by a YAML file (e.g., `00-postgresql-template.yaml`).\n",
      "* Parameters can be defined in the template, which can be used to customize the application configuration.\n",
      "\n",
      "**odo Tool**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The odo tool is a command-line tool provided by Red Hat for creating applications on OpenShift.\n",
      "* Devfiles are used with the odo tool, which contain information about an application's programming language, dependencies, and other essential details.\n",
      "* The odo tool supports various programming languages and frameworks out-of-the-box (e.g., .NET, Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, TypeScript).\n",
      "* The odo tool can be downloaded from the OpenShift Web Console through the \"Command line tools\" entry.\n",
      "* The odo init command creates a new application using a devfile, while the odo push command builds and pushes the container to the OpenShift container registry.\n",
      "\n",
      "These points provide an overview of how templates and the odo tool can be used with OpenShift for application development and deployment.\n",
